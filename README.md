Project for Math 163

Machine learning and data science, two rapidly growing subfields of CS, use algorithms to make sense of large amounts of data, uncover hidden patterns, and predict future events. In Project Euclid, we take the first steps towards using tools from data science to analyze ancient greek mathematics. The contributions of this project are two fold. First, we develop a web parser to automatically scrape Euclid Elements and store propositions and definitions in matrices/objects, making it far easier to analyze text and proof-definition networks and saving other students (in perhaps a future offering of this class) a significant data processing overhead. Second, we analyze these propositions through simple statistics, KMeans clustering, and singular value decomposition and offer some thoughts as to underlying patterns and structure. This project is released on github.com/anshulsamar/euclid under the MIT license and was built for Stanford University's Math 163: The Greek Invention of Mathematics. Development was in python using numpy, scipy, and beautifulsoup for web scraping.
